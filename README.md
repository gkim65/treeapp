## Our Hackathon Tree Website/App

### Team: TreeAppGang at Backyard Hacks Hackathon!

Our motivation for building this website was to encourage individuals to go outside and have more explorative experiences within nature. As one of our teammembers (Grace) as familiar with tree identification and the processes that went to differentiate between different trees, we decided to make a tree identification website that would help users distinguish between a small selection of trees! We took a few selections of trees from
each of the states we are from (Maryland, Florida, Texas, Nigeria) and this website came to life! Most of us had limited experience with website development, so it was difficult to get us adjusted to the whole framework of developing the websites and making it look somewhat presentable.

So the file structure of this website is split into 4 main components:
- the main home page called `index.html`
- The tree region of Nigeria
- The tree region of Eastern United States
- The tree region of Western United States

with each subset kept separate from each other, we were able to come up with a format that would allow the specific tree regions to link onto individual pages of the trees the user was trying to identify. 

The way the tree finding process works within the website is more of a question/answer format almost like a flowchart; guiding the user to find the tree they are looking for. Although it is not an exhaustive list for all of the trees, it has a few basic ones that allows for quick exploration!

Hope you all like it!
