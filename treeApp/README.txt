Treeapp Website!

Team: ________ at Backyard Hacks Hackathon!

Our motivation for building this website was to encourage individuals to go outside 
and have more explorative experiences within nature. As one of our teammembers (Grace)
was familiar with tree identification and the processes that went to differentiate between
different trees, we decided to make a tree identification website that would help users
distinguish between a small selection of trees! We took a few selections of trees from
each of the states we are from (Maryland, Florida, Texas, Nigeria) and this website came to life!

A responsive general purpose site template design named as such because it's the fourth
design up here (very creative I know). Has plenty of room for all sorts of content
and even multilevel drop down menus.
